Barcode File Location

For barcode images to appear correctly in Excel, PDF, and CSV exports, the barcode files should be stored in one of the following locations:

1. Primary Location: 
   /storage/app/public/[barcode path stored in database]
   For example, if database has "barcode/file.png", then file should be at:
   /storage/app/public/barcode/file.png

2. Alternative Location:
   /public/storage/[barcode path stored in database]
   For example, if database has "barcode/file.png", then file should be at:
   /public/storage/barcode/file.png

3. Filename-only Location (if database stores only filename):
   /storage/app/public/barcode/[filename]
   OR
   /public/storage/barcode/[filename]

Make sure that your storage link is published with:
php artisan storage:link

And ensure that all barcode images are accessible to the web server with proper permissions.
